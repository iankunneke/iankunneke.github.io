#Week 2 journal entry

  After completing 2 weeks at The Iron Yard I'm feeling good, although my brain is tired I love all the learning I've done. Theres a lot we have covered in terms of code but also about being a developer and thinking like one, like problem solving and trying to tackle problems better in a more efficient way. I have learned a lot about making some codes in a easier way so there isnt as much clutter on the screen and when we make apps I consider a lot of how the user experience will be in terms of how easy it is for them to navigate in the app. Button placement, text size and color are all very important aspects of an app. Another thing I'm getting a little more comfortable with is GitHub. Grasping the concept of branching on GitHub was a little tough at first but it makes sense now because as we write code its good to create sort of a checkpoint with a branch in case we end up making a mistake and need to go back to a previous point when the code was running fine.
